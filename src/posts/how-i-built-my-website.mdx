# How I Built My Website

When it comes to building my website, I was thinking a lot, and I wanted to make something unique, but the problem with my ideas is that they are so complicated, and it will take a lot of time. So I decided to make something that functions well and has a minimalist look. And that's how I did it:

## The stack

This was an easy decision since I am using React for all of my recent projects. So I used these tools:

`React`: A front-end library that allows you to build UI components and reuse them inside your application.

`Typescript` is a really powerful language built on top of Javascript that allows you to get the benefits of a static programming language.

`Tailwindcss` is a CSS library that is class-based and highly customizable for building great layouts.

`MDX`: MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content.

## Building the Layout

I start the project by making a design system. so that includes UI components like buttons, text,etc...

then making the app components, and here's how I structure my files:

```bash


   -src/

      -components/

      -ui/
         -Button.tsx


```

Now it's time to start creating:

I wanted the home page to be something attractive, so I built a mini terminal that shows something about me. Don't forget to check it out!

The rest of the home page was a simple about me section.

Moving to other pages, I made a [`portfolio`](https://u53f.com/portfolio) page, which basically shows some of my projects with some details.

Also, a [`contact`](https://u53f.com/contact) page is important. I made a form that allows anyone to send me a message via email using the form. I am using [`Emaijs`](https://emailjs.com) for managing emails.

Finally, the `blog` page, which I will talk about now.

## How Did I Create My Blog?

When I was building my website, I wanted to make a blog, and there are so many options to do that: Medium, Dev.to, etc.

but I wanted something customized and integrated with my website, as well as something that I could write in `Markdown`.

So I'm going to show you how my blog works so that you can build something similar.

The context is to write some Markdown documents and display them as blogs. So I needed a markdown compiler to transform markdown to HTML with custom styling.

I found this library called [`MDX`](https://mdxjs.com) that provides all those features that I mentioned.

To get started with it, make sure you install all necessary dependencies `(@types/)`, which are required if you are using typescript; otherwise, just ignore it.

```bash

npm i @types/mdx @mdx-js/rollup @mdx-js/react

```

Now you can use markdown files inside your components just like this:

```tsx
import MDXProvider from "@mdx-js/react";

import Post from "./post.mdx";

<MDXProvider components={components}>
   <Post /> 
</MDXProvider>;
```

You can check out the whole code right [`here`](https://github.com/n53337/u53f.com)

That's it, everyone. I hope you liked this one and gained some additional knowledge. I'll see you in the next one!
